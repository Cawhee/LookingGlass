#What is thisâ€½

Well, there are two ways of going about explaining what this is. Either, what this is, or what this was supposed to be. In this case I think I will do the latter considering the answer to the former is: Something I tried to make that doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it.
#What was this supposed to be?
This was supposed to be a simple line of javascript that you could add to the HEAD tag of any web application you were developing and the javascript would generate three buttons that you could then use to change the viewport. I'm sure there are plenty of scripts that already do this, but I wanted to try it out on my own.
#Liscense
What? Liscense to a broken piece of software? Well yes, I personally don't care what you do with the code(well, do tell me if you get it running.), but the icons are not mine. The icons come from [IcoMoon icon set](http://icomoon.io/) and are licensed as described at [http://icomoon.io/#icons#license](http://icomoon.io/#icons#license).
